TSVM-on-Python
==============

TSVm in python for anyone interested + grid search and a bit of visualisation and tests, as of now veery raw


Just look into makeDo.sh, it launches generate_preds which takes files from designated directory 
then tunes the svm and saves results to folder, then F1 computes F1 or mean F1 for multiclass classification 
and finally stores results in a .txt
